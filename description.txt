Added dedicated server support, become an admin by using /IRAuth command, you can check required code in server console by typing in "GetIRAuth", if there are any
admins only them will have permissions to change the config, "ClearAdmins" console command clears all admins (if you notice any bugs report them in the comments)

all big mods should be compatible, but I only test calamity

If mod doesn't work,it is probably because of another mod with respawn timer changes in it, if configs allow, disable all other respawn timer changes before loading my mod[quote=tModLoader ImprovedRespawning]
